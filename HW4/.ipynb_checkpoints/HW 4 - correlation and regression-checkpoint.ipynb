    "Correlation coefficient: We have talked about correlation and what it means in our lecture. Correlation coefficent is a number that measures how two columns are correlated. There are many kinds of correlation coefficients. We will use Pearson's Correlation coefficient. Given that the variables x and y have data points $x_1, x_2,..., x_n$ and $y_1, y_2,.., y_n$ then the correlation coefficient is defined by $r_{xy}=\\dfrac{\\displaystyle{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}}{\\sigma_x\\, \\sigma_y}$. The number\n",

    "$\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are means of x and y respectively. Here, $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$  are standard deviations of x and y, respectively. You do not have to worry about the complicated looking formula. We will use pandas to find the correlation.

    "Pairwise plot and Heatmap: Pair plot is the scatterplot of every two pairs of variables in the data. A correlation heatmap uses colored cells, typically in a monochromatic scale, to show a 2D correlation matrix (table) between two discrete dimensions or event types. The first dimension values appear as rows of the table, while the table's columns represent the values of the second dimension. The color value of the cells is proportional to the number of measurements that match the dimensional values. This enables you to identify incidence patterns quickly and to recognize anomalies.\n",
