    "Upload the movie data and do all the preliminary data analyses, such as finding and dealing with missing values, checking and correcting variable labels as numerical or categorical, etc. Our goal here is to train a CART classification model. Find the features you want to use. Use techniques we have learned in this class to select features that are important for a model. Here imdb_score is the dependent variable, but it has continuous values. To use a classification algorithm for this data, define a  new variable called 'imdb_labels' using 'imdb_score' in the following way.\n",

    "Use the data you used in the final model in problem 1 for this problem. You will train a KMeans clustering model in this problem. Remove the imdb_score and imdb_labels as you do not need a dependent variable for the clustering model. Train the KMeans model (no need to split in test and train) and find 4 clusters. The clustering algorithm finds clusters, and you do not need to worry about the accuracy score here (needs more advanced concepts). Find a pair of variables ( x and y) among the ones you used for the KMeans model and plot 4 clusters with 4 different colors. Try various x and y  before settling on a graph that clearly shows 4 clusters on the graph.  Here is a reference material on KMeans from one of the reference textbooks we use. https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.11-k-means.html"
